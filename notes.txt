Apache ZooKeeper (https://zookeeper.apache.org/) - A centralized system for storing and managing configuration

Things to do:

1. Start producing data:
  - Simulate customers creating accounts
  - Publish the data in a specific format - JSON, Protobuf, etc.
  - Have consumer save the data into a MySQL database

Streams and messages
 - InputStream takes in a std::basic_ios object which encapsulates file streams, stringstreams, boost iostreams, etc.
 - If an input stream is going to run continually (e.g. tcp server), the class needs to be notified when new data arrives
 - Json message stream may (optionally) need to take a callback to parse the input.

   E.g. Reading the users.json file requires iteration over each object in users[]
   if it is going to mimic a real event system
